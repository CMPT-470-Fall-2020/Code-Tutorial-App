# CMPT 470 Learning Project - Fall 2020
This repostory will contain all code for our semester long project. 

# Setting up the project after cloning
Whenever we install a library with `npm`, the code for the library is saved in a folder called `node-modules`. That folder has a large size and is almost always not included within the git repo to save space and make it faster to clone. When you clone this repository, you will need to run the command `npm install` within the root folder of the project(i.e. the folder which contains this README). This will install all libraries necessary(`React`, `mongoose`, `express` and so on...) and create a new folder called `node-modules`.

# Readme Contents
I have created the basic files using `Create-React-App`. There are several commands in the README. Please take a look at them. The most important one seems to be `npm start`. Additionally, `Create-React-App` uses `yarn` instead of `npm` by default. `yarn`  is an alternative to `npm` and it accomplishes the same job. Since we are all somewhat familiar with `npm`, I have converted the project from using `yarn` by default to `npm`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
